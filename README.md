# Covid Deaths by state and Population Density

## Project Discription
- We will be using supervised machine learning to build a Linear Regression model that we can use to predict total 
Covid deaths for a given state.

## Project Detail


### Why This Project?
- This topic has a large quantity of raw data that is easily accessed.
- The subject matter was interesting to each member of the group.
- We felt that the question and data would give us the ability to use a wide range of the skills we learned in class.
