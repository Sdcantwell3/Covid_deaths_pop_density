# Covid Deaths by state and Population Density

## Project Discription
- We will be using supervised machine learning to build a Linear Regression model that we can use to predict total 
Covid deaths for a given state.

## Why This Project?
- This topic has a large quantity of raw data that is easily accessed.
- The subject matter was interesting to each member of the group.
- We felt that the question and data would give us the ability to use a wide range of the skills we learned in class.

## Sourcing the Data
Below are the websites that we utilized to collect our data for the Analysis.

## Data Storage
- We used AWS to store and manipulate our raw data.

## Questions to Answer

- Primary: Will our model accurately predict the total number of deaths of other states in this same time period?

- Secondary: Does population density play a factor in total covid deaths?

## Data Exploration
- We were able to combine a few of the data tables that we sourced online to get a dataset that had all relevant information by state.
- We then went in and cleaned this dataset by dropping columns that were missing information or that we deemed irrelevant to our prediction.
- We also went through and reformatted specific columns as needed.

## Data Aanlysis
- We ran a number of trials through a supervised machine learning algorithm to build a model that we then tested on other states.
- During the data analysis we looked at 3 states with simiilar poplulation and varying population density.
- After running a few trials we took a look at the Feature Importance breakdown of our model and decided to further edit our data set to help accuracy.
- Our 5 trials can be found in the "Final Challenge Code" file in this repository.
